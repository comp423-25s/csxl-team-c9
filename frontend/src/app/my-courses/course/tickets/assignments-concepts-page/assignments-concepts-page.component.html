<!-- here is the navigation like we had in the figma --> 
 
<!-- <mat-card-title>Tickets</mat-card-title> reused header -->
<!-- add create button-->
<!-- <left-column><h2>Assignments</h1></left-column> headers for the two cols we will sort info into -->
<!-- <right-column><h2>Concepts</h2></right-column>  -->
<!-- <course-card> fake info for now bc need to ref backend -->
    <!-- <p>EX01</p> ass or concept -->
    <!-- <label> 7 </label> number of issues under the ass or concept -->
    <!-- <button> View </button> make view button link to group.component page -->

<!-- </course-card> -->

<!-- <course-card.widget>     
  
  
not sure how we are referencing this bc i keep trying the names and go to def but wont pull it up but widget in 
my-courses -> widgets -> course-card

we need to grab the name of the assignment, amt of tickets under it, and then the view button links to next page and gets tickets that relate to that 

  this is code from another but i just added as a refs...
    @for (sectionId of selectedSections(); track sectionId) { @if
    (sectionForId(sectionId)) {
    <mat-chip-row (removed)="remove(sectionForId(sectionId)!)">
      {{ sectionForId(sectionId)!.subject_code }}  
       
      we need to check if it is an assignment or concept and add it 
       accordingly to the correct column
       
       
      {{ sectionForId(sectionId)!.course_number }}-{{
        sectionForId(sectionId)!.section_number
      }}
      <label matChipRemove>
    </course-card-component>
  }} -->
